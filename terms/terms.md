## Website Mechanics, Third Party Services, and Privacy

### Website Attributions and Mechanics

Every page except the root directory[^4] of the website is created through a personally modified version of the [Skinny Bones theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/)[^5] of a blogging template called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The website itself is hosted through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme's built-in Google Adsense capabilities has been disabled on the Site.

### Privacy
Justin will never share any user's personal information[^6] without prior consent.

### Third Party Services

Third-party advertisers may place and read cookies on your browser and/or use web beacons to collect information. Justin has no access or control over these cookies. Each user is responsible for reviewing the respective privacy policies on any and all third-party ad servers for more information regarding their practices and how to opt-out. Alternatively, users can disable cookies through their web browser options. Instructions for doing so can be found on the specific web browsersâ€™ websites.

The Site uses Google Analytics to map out user interaction within the Site. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons to collect and store information such as the time of the current visit, the number of previous visits, and the method of referral to the Site, without identifying individual visitors. The privacy policy of Google Analytics can be found [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245).

[Blog posts]({{ site.url }}/blog/) use a commenting platform called [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), which, upon the user's comment submission, use "convenience cookies" to streamline future logins to the Disqus platform. The Site blocks any guest submissions, which means that users must log into a Disqus account should he/she wish to comment on any posts within the Site. Justin reserves the right to moderate[^7] certain comments without notice, under any reason. The privacy policy of Disqus can be found [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy), and the Terms of Service can be found [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466260-terms-of-service).

The [Contact page]({{ site.url }}/contact/) uses a service called [Formspree](http://formspree.io/), which gathers user input (Name, E-mail address, and Message) and sends the information to Justin's e-mail inbox. Formspree does not store any information submitted. Because Formspree uses Mailgun's API, Mailgun's privacy policy (found [here](http://www.mailgun.com/privacy)) may apply. Every user has the option to avoid using the contact form and instead contact Justin directly via the e-mail address(es) provided, should he/she object to using a third party to transmit information.
