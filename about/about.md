Hi! I'm Justin.

As a self-proclaimed **doofus**, **daydreamer**, and former **Lego fanatic**, I've always wanted to *make cool things*. Eventually, I hope to [document](/projects) some of the stuff I may or may not make during my next few years at the [North Avenue Trade School](http://www.gatech.edu "Georgia Tech").
