Hi! I'm Justin. Please do excuse the poor lanyard-work. 

As a doofus, daydreamer, and incoming [North Avenue Trade School](http://www.gatech.edu "Georgia Tech") freshman, I'll be documenting [my attempts to learn physics the hard way](/projects), or [anything else](/blog) that comes to mind.

#####Note: This website is currently under construction. I promise that I'll cough up more about myself later.
